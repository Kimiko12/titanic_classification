# Task Description
The classification task in the context of the Titanic dataset is to predict whether a passenger will survive or not based on a set of features (e.g., sex, age, ticket class, etc.). This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable takes a value of 1 if the passenger survived and 0 if not.

# Features
The input data includes various features that may be useful for predicting passenger survival. Some of these features may include:

Sex: Male or Female.
Age: Age of the passenger.
Ticket class: The class in which the passenger traveled (1, 2, or 3).
Number of relatives: Number of relatives or spouses aboard.
Cabin availability: Whether the passenger had a cabin or not.
Embarked port: The port where the passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).


# Model
To solve the classification task, it is important to choose an appropriate machine learning model. Some of the most commonly used models for this task include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting


# Evaluation
Various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC may be used to evaluate the quality of the model. Additionally, cross-validation may be performed for a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

# Process
Data Preparation: Loading data, cleaning, handling missing values, categorical feature encoding, and feature scaling.
Model Selection: Choosing a suitable model for training.
Model Training: Training the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.
Fine-Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
Interpreting Results: Interpreting and analyzing the results to understand the contribution of features and factors affecting survival.
